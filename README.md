# NASA-Space-Apps-2022
# Welcome

Welcome to our space exploration and discovery tool! Feel free to explore the scripts and app to see what we created and visualized using data from the Parker Solar Probe. While the scripts give you access to the logic behind the visualizations, the audio representations we created can only be heard in the app.
## How does this work?

Feel free to use the .exe file to install our app on your local machine. This application will only run on a Windows OS. 

You will need to to download the MATLAB Runtime for MATLAB R2022b Windows Version, found [here](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html). To run the app once installed, please navigate to the directory it installed into and run the program from there after installing the MATLAB Runtime.

### For MATLAB Users:

Feel free to download the files and open the .prj folder in MATLAB. This will open the project and configure your environment to run all the scripts. You can get started with the Main.mlx script.
